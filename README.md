Ooh i travelled far
Think i can see the stars
All these times ive been away
Collecting all these scars
And when i thought so naively im almost there
I realized with my own eyes i only moved a square
Well i guess thats just how it is
Turnout the answer was the quiz
Turnout it was me all along
Why the climbing feels so long but still i be strong
Will i ever see the finish line?
I dunno but i keep my climb
The more i get the more i grind
The more the numbers in my bank
The more the numbers of my show
The more i smoke them loud ass dank
The more distance i would go
Wish me luck for im too deep up in my journey
Bismillah i pray my fire wont stop burning
Wish me luck
Bismillah
Wish me luck
Bismillah
Will it be worthy of my time
My tears, my blood, my dime?
Will u stay here if i went overtime?
U will never ever know
U think too much ull never go
Ull have it all
But not control
U want the fortune and the glory
Bad bitches in a brand new cabriolet
Big house floored by marble and parquet
Do you only love the result or do you love the play?
Do you even wanna stay when you know the price to pay?
Only thing that i could say, when shit go outta my way
Wish me luck for im too deep up in my journey
Bismillah i pray my fire wont stop burning
Wish me luck
Bismillah
Wish me luck
Bismillah
Forgive me Ma'
For judging your choices
I was young and dumb and broke
My ego got in the way
Now I know Ma'
That you're just doing all the best you can
Life's a beast that we foolishly try to conquer
As i'm gonna take my first step
Please send me bismillah
Coz I'm gonna need it
Wish me luck for im too deep up in my journey
Bismillah i pray my fire wont stop burning
Wish me luck
Bismillah
Wish me luck
Bismillah
Belum lama dunia jungkir balik
Every single little thing tak ada yang baik-baik
Dari mulut keluar kata-kata engga baik
From the morning to the day
To the noon and to the night
Sampe hari ini, sampe cape buat fight
Tapi roda tu bundar
Ia bakal berputar
Tahun ini kalimat
Dari mulut kutukar
Now im saying bismillah
Kita mulai lagilah
Semua butuh wish me luck
Dunia udah gilak
Ooh i travelled far
Think i can see the stars
All these times ive been away
Collecting all these scars
And when i thought so naively im almost there
I realize with my own eyes i only moved a square
